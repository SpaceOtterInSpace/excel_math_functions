unit_conversions
circ_segment

cp_water
cp_glycol
================

These are all the functions I've created in vba

The Engineering library is meant to hold all the functions. 
If using, copy the engineering libraray into a module in your excel sheet.(you can get there by alt+F11)
They will then act just like any of the other already existing functions.
If you hit shift+alt+a after typing the function name, it will tell you what variables to put in.

Also, If you copy into the personal excel folder, it should then be available to you whenever you open excel.
